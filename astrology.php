     <meta name="description" content="Santosh Sharmaa online astrology prediction free in Bangalore,Vedic astrology (JYOTISH) readings assume the law of karma and past births. That is why, in our horoscopes we find mention of “Dasha Bhukti balance.There are resonance relationships between the planets, colors and other phenomena. Each planet is resonant with specific frequencies of the color spectrum." />

              <p>The whole universe is nothing but energies of different forms. Energy neither can be created nor can be destroyed. We talk of soul in terms of energy which is indestructible and eternal. Astrology which we call Jyotish is a science of soul’s journey. We are born with a life journey map. This map is our chart or kundali. We are born with these charts based on our past karmas. </p>
              <p>Kundali means potential energy in a coiled form which unravels itself as the individual’s life progresses.</p>
              <p>It is like a hard disk with a programming and a person thinks, behaves and reacts to situations in a pre-programmed way which we call Lagna, Rasi and Nakshtra effects. It is the Prakruti or nature of a person which more or less remains unchanged throughout his or her life. </p>
              <p>We human beings exist in a spectrum of light. It is between Infra-red and Ultra-violet and these are basically two nodes called Rahu and Ketu and these two always remain in a 180 degree axis. Between these two are all seven colors which are the Grahas. Each one denotes a color, like Saturn is blue and Jupiter is yellow etc. When we say Saturn is Vakri (retrograde) it means that the frequency of blue colour energy is not in consonance with our body frequency. So, when we wear a blue sapphire the deficient blue colour energy frequencies in our body get balanced.</p>
              <h4>Jyoti means light. Jyotish means Light is God. Light is a form of energy. </h4>
              <p>The whole universe is filled with  energies of different forms. Energy  can neither be created nor destroyed. We talk of soul in terms of energy which is indestructible and eternal.</p>
