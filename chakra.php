            The word "chakra" means "wheel or disk". These energy vortexes/wheels are the channels through which energy flows in & out. Chakras are “entry gates” of the aura ( energy field that surrounds our physical body). Chakras constantly rotate and vibrate. The activities in the chakras influence our body shape, glandular processes, physical/mental ailments, emotions and behavior. When one or more of the chakras are blocked, the energy does not flow harmoniously, or if they are too open, it will result in energy imbalance.
